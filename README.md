# PARP_25L_projekt
This is a repository with a text-based game where your main objective is to complete a workout at the gym and finish some side quests to do so.
The game was written in three separate, unconventional prigramming languages:
- Prolog
- Haskell
- Smalltalk

Exemplary walkthroughs are added as .txt files in each directory
